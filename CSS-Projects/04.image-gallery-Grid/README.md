In this example, we're using CSS Grid to create a responsive image gallery with 1,2,3,4 columns respectively. Each image is wrapped in a container with the .imgDiv class, which includes the hover effects for the images. When hovering over an image, it scales up and a semi-transparent overlay appears. This creates a simple yet visually appealing hover effect for the images in the gallery.

Make sure to replace the src attributes of the `<img>` elements with the actual paths to your images.

Feel free to adjust the styling and gallery layout according to your preferences and design requirements.
