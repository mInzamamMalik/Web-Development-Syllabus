incomplete 

Create a responsive portfolio page using HTML and CSS. The goal is to practice responsive design principles by adjusting the layout and styles of the page based on different screen sizes.

## Instructions

1. Start with the following [basic HTML structure](./start.html) for your portfolio page.

1. Create a CSS file named styles.css and apply initial styling to the elements. Focus on the desktop layout styles.

1. Implement **Media queries** to adjust the layout and styles for different screen sizes. Consider the following breakpoints:

   - Mobile: Up to 768px
   - Tablet: 769px to 1024px
   - Desktop: 1025px and above

## Requirements

- The header should be centered and have larger font sizes for different screen sizes.
- The navigation menu should become a collapsible menu (hamburger menu) for mobile and tablet screens.
- The main content should have appropriate margins and padding.
- The "About Me" section should have centered text.
- The portfolio items in the "My Portfolio" section should be displayed in a grid for desktop screens and a single column for mobile and tablet screens.
- Adjust font sizes and line heights for readability on different screen sizes.
- The footer should be centered and have a smaller font size for mobile screens.

### Bonus

- Add CSS transitions for smooth animations when elements change sizes or positions.
- Experiment with different layout techniques, such as flexbox or CSS Grid, to achieve the responsive layout.
