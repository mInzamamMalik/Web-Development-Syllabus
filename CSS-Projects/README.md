# CSS Projects for Students

Here are some CSS assignments that can help your students practice and improve their CSS skills:

1. [**Basic Styling:**](./CSS-Projects/01.project-basic/README.md)
   Ask students to create a simple webpage with HTML and apply various CSS styling properties such as font styles, colors, margins, paddings, and borders. The goal is to get them comfortable with the basic concepts of CSS.

1. **Navigation Bar:**
   Task students with creating a navigation bar that includes horizontal or vertical menu items. They can practice styling the menu items, adding hover effects, and potentially implementing a responsive navigation for smaller screens.

1. **Image Gallery:**
   Have students build an image gallery using CSS grid or flexbox. This assignment helps them practice layout techniques and hover effects for images.

1. **Card Components:**
   Instruct students to create reusable card components. They can style these cards with various features like shadows, border-radius, and hover effects.

1. **Form Styling:**
   Provide a basic form structure and ask students to style it with CSS. They can work on designing text inputs, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and select dropdowns.

1. **Responsive Design:**
   Provide a basic HTML structure and challenge students to make the page responsive using media queries. They should adjust the layout and styles based on different screen sizes.

1. **CSS Transitions and Animations:**
   Challenge students to create a simple animation, such as a fading slideshow or a rotating banner, using CSS transitions and keyframe animations.

1. **CSS Variables:**
   Introduce students to CSS variables and ask them to create a stylesheet that uses variables for colors, fonts, and other commonly used properties.

1. **Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements:**
   Have students create a set of buttons that change appearance on hover and click using pseudo-classes. They can also experiment with pseudo-elements to add decorative elements before or after content.

1. **Gradient Backgrounds:**
   Task students with creating visually appealing gradient backgrounds using CSS gradients. They can experiment with linear and radial gradients.

1. **Responsive Typography:**
   Provide a piece of text and have students style it using responsive typography techniques. They can adjust font sizes, line heights, and other typographic properties based on different screen sizes.

1. **CSS Flexbox Challenge:**
   Present students with a layout challenge where they need to create a specific design using CSS flexbox. This can help them practice their flexbox skills.
